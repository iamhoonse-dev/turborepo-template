# ðŸš€ Quickstart

## Use this template

After clicking the "Use this template" button to create your repository, run the commands below.

## Install dependencies

To use the monorepo commands provided by this project, you must first install dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Change owner ID

This command traverses all files in the codebase and replaces occurrences of the existing owner ID.
For more details, see the [`tools/cli` README](./tools/cli/README.md#-provided-features).

```bash
change-owner-name --name your-username
```

## Change repository name

This command traverses all files in the codebase and replaces occurrences of the existing repository name.
For more details, see the [`tools/cli` README](./tools/cli/README.md#-provided-features).

```bash
rename-repository --name new-repository-name
```

## Change scope name

This command traverses all files in the codebase and replaces occurrences of the existing scope name.
If you need to publish some components in the monorepo to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) under a specific scope (e.g. `new-scope-name`), this will be useful.
For more details, see the [`tools/cli` README](./tools/cli/README.md#-provided-features).

```bash
rename-scope --name new-scope-name
```

## Run development server

Now you can run the development server and check the application. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Enjoy it !

Happy Hacking!
