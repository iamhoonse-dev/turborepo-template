# 🧰 Helper Functions

The `shared/helpers` package provides general-purpose utility (helper) functions that can be commonly used across multiple packages and apps.

## 🎯 Main Purpose

- Gathers duplicated logic in one place to increase reusability and improve code quality and maintainability.
- These helper functions are not published to npm and are only used within the monorepo.

## 📁 Main Components

- **Function Collection**:  
  Includes helper functions for string processing, array/object manipulation, type checking, path handling, and more for various use cases.
- **Type Definitions**:  
  Provides type safety based on TypeScript.

## 🧑‍💻 ️Usage in Other Workspaces

To use these helper functions in another workspace, follow these steps:

### ➕ Add as a Dependency

Add the package as a dependency in your `package.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/helpers": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

### 🧑‍💻️ Usage Example

Now you can import and use the helper functions. For example, here's how to use the `runWithGlob` function provided by the `helpers` package:

```typescript filename="packages/browser-utils/vite.config.ts"
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { runWithGlob } from "@repo/helpers/runWithGlob";
import { resolve } from "path";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...existing code...
  build: {
    // ...existing code...
    lib: {
      entry: Object.fromEntries(
        runWithGlob(
          "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
          (file) => [
            // Entry name
            file.replace(/^src\//, "").replace(/index\.(ts|tsx)$/, ""),
            // Absolute path
            resolve(__dirname, file),
          ],
          ["src/**/*.{d,spec}.ts"],
        ),
      ),
      // ...existing code...
    },
  },
  // ...existing code...
});
```

- For the actual list of functions and usage, refer to the source and README of the `shared/helpers` package.
- If you have logic that is commonly needed, add it to this package so it can be reused in multiple places.
