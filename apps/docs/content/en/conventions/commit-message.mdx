# üìù commitlint

This project uses [`commitlint`](https://commitlint.js.org/) to check the format of commit messages and ensure they follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) convention via an automated script.

## How it works

When you make a commit, the `commit-msg` Git Hook automatically runs `commitlint`.
That is, every time you commit, the commit message is automatically checked for compliance with the convention.
Depending on the result, the commit will either succeed or be rejected.

## Convention Configuration

The commit message convention is defined in the `.commitlintrc.json` file at the root directory.

module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
};
