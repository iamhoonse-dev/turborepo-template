# üõ°Ô∏è ESLint

This project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to maintain code quality and apply consistent style.
ESLint is a tool that detects potential errors in JavaScript and TypeScript code and checks code style,
which is very helpful for maintaining consistency in code style during collaboration.

## How to Run

### Command

ESLint checks are performed using the `lint` CLI. However, the way you run the command depends on where you run it.

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

#### Running at the project root

The `lint` command defined in the root `package.json` is set to run a turbo task.
So, running `pnpm run lint` at the root directory will make Turbo run ESLint checks in parallel for all workspaces.

```bash filename="package.json" {3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "turbo run lint"
    // ...existing code...
  }
}
```

#### Running in an individual workspace

Each workspace's `package.json` also defines a `lint` script, which you can run directly.
In this case, turbo tasks are not used, and ESLint checks are performed only for that workspace.
That is, ESLint checks are run directly without using Turbo's parallel execution and caching features.

```bash filename="apps/docs/package.json" {3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint --max-warnings 0"
    // ...existing code...
  }
}
```

### Turbo Task

As mentioned above, running `pnpm run lint` at the project root executes the `lint` task defined as a turbo task.
The `lint` task is defined in the `turbo.json` file at the project root as follows:

```json filename="turbo.json" {3-5}
{
  "tasks": {
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["build", "^lint"]
    }
    // ...existing code...
  }
}
```

### Build Required

Due to the way packages are built in this project, you must run the build before running ESLint checks.
Since each package includes the built code in the bundle,
ESLint checks may not work correctly if the build is not complete.
Therefore, the `lint` task's `dependsOn` field is set to depend on the `build` task.

## ESLint Config

### Shared Config

Shared ESLint configs are located under the `configs/eslint-config` directory.
There are several ESLint config files in this directory, each set for a specific purpose.

- `base.js`: Contains the basic ESLint settings. This defines the base rules applied to all ESLint config files.
- `react-internal.js`: ESLint settings for workspaces using React. Includes React-related rules.
- `next.js`: ESLint settings for workspaces using Next.js. Includes Next.js-related rules.

### Inheriting Shared Config

Each workspace can inherit the shared ESLint config as-is or define additional rules.

#### Using as-is

The `apps/docs` workspace uses the Next.js ESLint config defined in `configs/eslint-config/next.js` as-is.

```js filename="apps/docs/.eslintrc.js" {1,4}
// ...existing code...
import { nextJsConfig } from "@repo/eslint-config/next-js";

/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
export default nextJsConfig;
// ...existing code...
```

#### Extending

The `apps/frontend-workshop` workspace extends the React ESLint config in `configs/eslint-config/react-internal.js` to apply React-related rules.

```js filename="apps/frontend-workshop/eslint.config.js" {3,8}
// ...existing code...
import reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";
import { config } from "@repo/eslint-config/react-internal";

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ["dist", "storybook-static"] },
  {
    extends: [...config],
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],

    // ...existing code...
  },
);
// ...existing code...
```

## ESLint Plugins

### Writing Your Own

You can also write and use your own ESLint plugins in this project.

- To write a new ESLint plugin, refer to the <LocalizedLink href="/packages/add-new-package/eslint-plugin">`Packages > Add New Package > ESLint Plugin`</LocalizedLink> document.
- For more details about the `eslint-plugin-sample` package, see the <LocalizedLink href="/packages/default-packages/eslint-plugin-sample">`Packages > Sample Package > eslint-plugin-samples`</LocalizedLink> document.

### Applying to ESLint Config

The ESLint rules you write can be applied to your ESLint config.
For example, in the `configs/eslint-config/base.js` file, you can see that the rules written in the `eslint-plugin-sample` package are applied as follows.
Similarly, after writing a new ESLint rule, you can add it to your ESLint config in the same way.

#### Adding as a Dependency

To apply your ESLint plugin to the ESLint config, add the plugin to the `devDependencies` of the `eslint-config` package.

```json filename="configs/eslint-config/package.json" {4}
{
  // ...existing code...
  "devDependencies": {
    "@repo/eslint-plugin-sample": "workspace:*",
    // ...existing code...
  },
}
```

Then, run the following command to install the `eslint-plugin-sample` package as a dependency of the `eslint-config` package.

```bash
pnpm install --filter @repo/eslint-config
```

#### Applying to Config

Now you can apply your ESLint plugin to the ESLint config file in the `eslint-config` package.

<Callout type="info">
  This example shows how to apply an ESLint plugin in the `base.js` file,
  but you can apply ESLint plugins in the same way in other ESLint config files (e.g. `next.js`, `react-internal.js`, ...).
</Callout>

```js filename="configs/eslint-config/base.js" {2,13}
// ...existing code...
import samplePlugin from "@repo/eslint-plugin-sample";

/**
 * A shared ESLint configuration for the repository.
 *
 * @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config[]}
 * */
export const config = [
  // ...existing code...
  {
    plugins: {
      sample: samplePlugin,
    },
    rules: {
      "sample/no-new-date": "warn", // Apply the rule written in the eslint-plugin-sample package
    },
  },
];
```
