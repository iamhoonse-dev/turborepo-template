# 🤖 Automated Convention Checking Environment

This project uses [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to set up Git Hooks and automatically check code quality before commits.
This environment helps prevent errors in advance during code writing and helps maintain a consistent code style.

## ⬇️ Installation & Setup

Husky is installed and initialized via the `prepare` script defined in the root `package.json` file.
That is, when you run the `pnpm install` command in your local environment, husky is automatically installed and Git Hooks are set up.

```json filename="package.json" {3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

## ⚓️ Git Hook

Git Hook scripts are located in the `.husky` folder at the root directory.

### `pre-commit`

The `pre-commit` hook runs before a commit and performs the following tasks:

- **Linting**: Checks code style and quality using `eslint`.
- **Formatting**: Applies code formatting using `prettier`.
- **Type Checking**: Performs TypeScript type checking using the `tsc --noEmit` command.

<Callout type="info">
  All commands executed in the `pre-commit` hook are defined as Turbo tasks.
  This means the hook leverages Turbo's caching and parallel execution features for fast and efficient processing.
</Callout>

```bash filename=".husky/pre-commit" {3-5}
echo "🔍 Applying lint rules before commit..."
if (
  pnpm run lint &&
  pnpm run format:check &&
  pnpm run check-types
); then
  echo "✅ All lint rules applied successfully."
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ An error occurred during lint rule checking."
  exit 1
fi
```

### `commit-msg`

The `commit-msg` hook uses the `commitlint` CLI to check whether the commit message follows the convention.
If the message does not comply, the commit is rejected.

```bash filename=".husky/commit-msg" {6}
COMMIT_MESSAGE_FILE=$1
COMMIT_MESSAGE=$(cat "$COMMIT_MESSAGE_FILE")

echo "❤️‍🩹 Commit Message: $COMMIT_MESSAGE"

npx commitlint --edit $1

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "🔆 Commit message meets the convention 🔆"
  exit 0
else
  echo "❌ Commit message does not meet the convention ❌"
  exit 1
fi
```
