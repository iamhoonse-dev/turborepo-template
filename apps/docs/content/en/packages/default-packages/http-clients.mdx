# 🌐 HTTP Clients

## 📖 Overview

The `http-clients` package is an internal package that provides utilities and client code for handling HTTP requests.

## 🎯 Main Purpose

This package is designed with the following main purposes:

- Provides HTTP client instances (`self`, `iamhoonse.dev`) for consistent request handling
- Provides HTTP clients usable in both web browsers and Node.js environments
- Vite-based build settings to support code splitting and tree shaking
- Settings to provide TypeScript declaration files

## 📦 Provided Features

- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/http-clients/src/instances">**Instances**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides HTTP client instances such as `self` and `iamhoonse.dev`.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/http-clients/src/mocks">**Mocks**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides request handlers related to `self` and `iamhoonse.dev` for use with MSW (Mock Service Worker).
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/http-clients/src/types">**Types**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Defines types related to HTTP requests and responses.

## 🛠️ Build Method & Main Settings

This package is built as a multi-entry library based on Vite and TypeScript.  
Each feature is provided as a separate entry (`instances`, `mocks`, `types`), and the build outputs are generated in the `dist` folder as ES modules (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats.

### package.json

- **exports**: Each feature is separated as an entry (`./instances`, `./mocks`, `./types`), and provides type declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules, and CJS modules.
- **private**: Set to `"private": true` to prevent public npm distribution.
- **files**: Only build outputs (`dist`) are included in the package.
- **scripts**: Various development scripts are defined, such as build, type check, and test using Vite and TypeScript.

### vite.config.ts

- **Multi-entry build**: Uses the `runWithGlob` utility from `shared/helpers` to automatically detect entry files in the `src` folder and register them as build entries.
- **Library mode**: Uses Vite's library mode to build in both ES/CJS formats.
- **Type declarations**: Automatically generates type declaration files for each entry using `vite-plugin-dts`.
- **Path aliases**: Supports TypeScript path aliases with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.

### tsconfig.json

- **Module resolution**: Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for bundler-friendly module resolution.
- **Type support**: Configured to support the latest ECMAScript, Node.js, and DOM types.
- **Strict mode**: Type checking and lint-related options are strictly applied.
- **Path aliases**: Uses path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` to improve code readability.
