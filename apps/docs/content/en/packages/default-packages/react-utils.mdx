## üìñ Overview

The `react-utils` package provides utility functions and tools for React application development.

## üéØ Main Purpose

When you want to add a new React utility package, you can copy this package as a starting point for development.
It is designed with the following purposes:

- Sets React and ReactDOM as external dependencies to utilize APIs such as Hooks, Context API, and utility types provided by React
- TypeScript settings to support JSX transformation
- Vite-based build settings to support code splitting and tree shaking
- Settings to provide TypeScript declaration files
- Various `package.json` settings required for public npm distribution

## üì¶ Provided Features

- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/react-utils/src/hooks">**Hooks**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides a collection of useful custom hooks for use in React applications.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/react-utils/src/hocs">**HoCs**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides various higher-order components to assist React component development.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/react-utils/src/providers">**Providers**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides utilities that utilize React Context.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Method & Main Settings

This package is built as a multi-entry library based on Vite and TypeScript.  
Each feature is provided as a separate entry (`hooks`, `hocs`, `providers`), and the build outputs are generated in the `dist` folder as ES modules (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats.

### package.json

- **exports**: Each feature is separated as an entry (`./hooks`, `./hocs`, `./providers`), and provides type declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules, and CJS modules.
- **publishConfig**: Set to `"access": "public"` to allow public npm distribution.
- **files**: Only build outputs (`dist`) are included in the package.
- **peerDependencies**: Specifies `react` and `react-dom` as external dependencies, requiring them to be installed directly in the project.
- **scripts**: Various development scripts are defined, such as build, type check, and test using Vite and TypeScript.

### vite.config.ts

- **Multi-entry build**: Uses the `runWithGlob` utility from `shared/helpers` to automatically detect entry files in the `src` folder and register them as build entries.
- **Library mode**: Uses Vite's library mode to build in both ES/CJS formats.
- **Type declarations**: Automatically generates type declaration files for each entry using `vite-plugin-dts`.
- **Path aliases**: Supports TypeScript path aliases with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.
- **External dependencies**: Treats `react`, `react-dom`, and `react/jsx-runtime` as external dependencies, not included in the bundle.

### tsconfig.json

- **Module resolution**: Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for bundler-friendly module resolution.
- **Type support**: Configured to support the latest ECMAScript, DOM, and React types.
- **JSX**: Supports React 17+ JSX transformation with `"jsx": "react-jsx"`.
- **Strict mode**: Type checking and lint-related options are strictly applied.
