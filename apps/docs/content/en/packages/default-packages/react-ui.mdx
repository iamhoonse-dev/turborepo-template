## 📖 Overview

The `react-ui` package is a React component library that simplifies UI development and provides reusable components.

## 🎯 Main Purpose

When you want to add a new UI package available as React components, you can copy this package as a starting point for development.
It is designed with the following purposes:

- Settings to support Tailwind CSS-based styling
- Settings to utilize ShadCN UI components as base components
- Sets React and ReactDOM as external dependencies to utilize APIs such as Hooks, Context API, and utility types provided by React
- TypeScript settings to support JSX transformation
- Vite-based build settings to support code splitting and tree shaking
- Settings to provide TypeScript declaration files
- Various `package.json` settings required for public npm distribution

## 📦 Provided Features

- **[ShadCN UI](./shadcn-ui)**: Provides modules related to ShadCN UI.
- **[Utils](./utils)**: Provides a collection of UI-related utility functions for use in React applications.
- **[Components](./components)**: Provides various React UI components.
- **[Constants](./constants)**: Provides style-related constants such as breakpoints for responsive design.
- **[Base CSS](./base.css)**: Provides the base style file.

## 🛠️ Build Method & Main Settings

This package is built as a multi-entry library based on Vite and TypeScript.  
Each feature is provided as a separate entry (`shadcn-ui`, `utils`, `components`, `constants`, `base.css`), and the build outputs are generated in the `dist` folder as ES modules (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats.

### package.json

- **exports**: Each feature is separated as an entry (`shadcn-ui`, `utils`, `components`, `constants`, `base.css`), and provides type declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules, and CJS modules.
- **publishConfig**: Set to `"access": "public"` to allow public npm distribution.
- **files**: Only build outputs (`dist`) are included in the package.
- **peerDependencies**: Specifies `react` and `react-dom` as external dependencies, requiring them to be installed directly in the project.
- **scripts**: Various development scripts are defined, such as build, type check, and test using Vite and TypeScript.

### vite.config.ts

- **Multi-entry build**: Uses the `runWithGlob` utility to automatically detect entry files in the `src` folder and register them as build entries.
- **Library mode**: Uses Vite's library mode to build in both ES/CJS formats.
- **Type declarations**: Automatically generates type declaration files for each entry using `vite-plugin-dts`.
- **Path aliases**: Supports TypeScript path aliases with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.
- **External dependencies**: Treats `react`, `react-dom`, and `react/jsx-runtime` as external dependencies, not included in the bundle.

### tsconfig.json

- **Module resolution**: Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for bundler-friendly module resolution.
- **Type support**: Configured to support the latest ECMAScript, DOM, and React types.
- **JSX**: Supports React 17+ JSX transformation with `"jsx": "react-jsx"`.
- **Strict mode**: Type checking and lint-related options are strictly applied.
- **Path aliases**: Uses path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` to improve code readability.
