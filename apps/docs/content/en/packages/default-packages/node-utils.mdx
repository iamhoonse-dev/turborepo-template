## üìñ Overview

The `node-utils` package provides various utility functions for use in Node.js environments.

## üéØ Main Purpose

When you want to add a new package that runs in a Node.js environment, you can copy this package as a starting point for development.
It is designed with the following purposes:

- Basic build settings to utilize APIs provided in Node.js environments such as os, fs, process
- Vite-based build settings to support code splitting and tree shaking
- Settings to provide TypeScript declaration files
- Various `package.json` settings required for public npm distribution

## üì¶ Provided Features

- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/node-utils/src/fs">**fs**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides utility functions related to the file system.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/node-utils/src/msw">**msw**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides MSW-related utility functions for API mocking.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/node-utils/src/misc">**misc**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides other useful utility functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Method & Main Settings

This package is built as a multi-entry library based on Vite and TypeScript.  
Each feature is provided as a separate entry (`fs`, `msw`, `misc`), and the build outputs are generated in the `dist` folder as ES modules (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats.

### package.json

- **exports**: Each feature is separated as an entry (`./fs`, `./msw`, `./misc`), and provides type declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules, and CJS modules.
- **publishConfig**: Set to `"access": "public"` to allow public npm distribution.
- **files**: Only build outputs (`dist`) are included in the package.
- **scripts**: Various development scripts are defined, such as build, type check, and test using Vite and TypeScript.

### vite.config.ts

- **Multi-entry build**: Uses the `runWithGlob` utility from `shared/helpers` to automatically detect entry files in the `src` folder and register them as build entries.
- **Library mode**: Uses Vite's library mode to build in both ES/CJS formats.
- **Type declarations**: Automatically generates type declaration files for each entry using `vite-plugin-dts`.
- **Path aliases**: Supports TypeScript path aliases with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.

### tsconfig.json

- **Module resolution**: Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for bundler-friendly module resolution.
- **Type support**: Configured to support the latest ECMAScript and Node.js types.
- **Strict mode**: Type checking and lint-related options are strictly applied.
- **Path aliases**: Uses path aliases defined in `tsconfig.json` to improve code readability.
