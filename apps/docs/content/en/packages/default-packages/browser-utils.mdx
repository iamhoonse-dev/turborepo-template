## üìñ Overview

The `browser-utils` package provides utility functions and tools that are useful in browser environments.

## üéØ Main Purpose

When you want to add a new package that runs in the browser, you can copy this package as a starting point for development.
It is designed with the following purposes:

- Basic build settings to utilize APIs provided in browser environments such as DOM
- Vite-based build settings to support code splitting and tree shaking
- Settings to provide TypeScript declaration files
- Various `package.json` settings required for public npm distribution

## üì¶ Provided Features

As examples of features that work in the browser environment, the `browser-utils` package includes the following sample features:

- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/browser-utils/src/dom">**DOM**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides utility functions for manipulating the browser DOM.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/browser-utils/src/msw">**MSW**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides utilities related to Mock Service Worker.
- <CodeRepositoryLink href="/packages/browser-utils/src/string">**String**</CodeRepositoryLink>: Provides utility functions for string processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Method & Main Settings

This package is built as a multi-entry library based on Vite and TypeScript.  
Each feature is provided as a separate entry (`string`, `dom`, `msw`), and the build outputs are generated in the `dist` folder as ES modules (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats.

### package.json

- **exports**: Each feature is separated as an entry (`./string`, `./dom`, `./msw`), and provides type declarations (`.d.ts`), ES modules, and CJS modules.
- **publishConfig**: Set to `"access": "public"` to allow public npm distribution.
- **files**: Only build outputs (`dist`) are included in the package.
- **scripts**: Various development scripts are defined, such as build, type check, test, and MSW initialization using Vite and TypeScript.
- **msw**: Includes settings to specify the distribution directory for MSW worker files.

### vite.config.ts

- **Multi-entry build**: Uses the `runWithGlob` utility from `shared/helpers` to automatically detect entry files in the `src` folder and register them as build entries.
- **Library mode**: Uses Vite's library mode to build in both ES/CJS formats.
- **Type declarations**: Automatically generates type declaration files for each entry using `vite-plugin-dts`.
- **Path aliases**: Supports TypeScript path aliases with `vite-tsconfig-paths`.

### tsconfig.json

- **Module resolution**: Uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` for bundler-friendly module resolution.
- **Type support**: Configured to support the latest ECMAScript and DOM types.
- **Strict mode**: Type checking and lint-related options are strictly applied.
