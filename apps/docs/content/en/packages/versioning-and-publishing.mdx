# 🦋 Versioning and Publishing

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to simplify package version management and publishing.
Changesets are especially useful in a monorepo environment, helping you track changes for each package and update versions accordingly.

This document explains how this project is set up to manage and publish package versions using `pnpm` and `Changesets`.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To use `Changesets` in this project, some preparation is required. Please follow the steps below.

### Required

- Refer to the <LocalizedLink href="/setup/github-apps/changeset-bot">`Setup > GitHub Apps > changeset-bot`</LocalizedLink> document to set up the Changesets bot.
- Refer to the <LocalizedLink href="/setup/github-actions/gh-actions-permission">`Setup > GitHub Actions > Repository Permission Settings`</LocalizedLink> document to configure GitHub Actions permissions.

### Optional

- Refer to the <LocalizedLink href="/setup/npm">`Setup > NPM`</LocalizedLink> document to set up the NPM token and enable npm publishing in the workflow.

## 🔄 Versioning and Publishing Process

  For more details on the changeset-based versioning and publishing process, please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
</Callout>

### (1) ✏️ Add New Changes

Run the following command locally to open a prompt where you can describe your changes.

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

After following the prompt and writing your changes,

![CLI prompt](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-1.png)

Changesets will create a new changeset file and commit it.

|Commit|changeset|
|-|-|
|![CLI-created-commit](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-2.png)|![CLI-created-changeset](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-2-1.png)|

### (2) 🦋 Create a PR with the New Changeset Commit

#### 1) Create a New Changeset PR

Push the new changeset commit you created locally and open a PR.
The changeset-bot will automatically detect the new changeset commit in the PR and summarize the changes in a comment like below.

![changeset-bot-reply-to-pr](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-3.png)

<Callout type="info">
  **If there is no changeset commit** \
  The changeset-bot will leave a comment notifying you that no changeset commit was found. \
  ![changeset-bot-reply-to-pr-2](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-3-1.png)
</Callout>

#### 2) Approve the New Changeset PR

When you approve the PR containing the new changeset, the changeset-bot will run the following command in the `release` workflow.

```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

![commits-in-pr](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-4.png)

This command updates the package version (`version` field in `package.json`) based on the changes included in the PR and adds another commit updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

![commits-in-pr](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-5.png)

#### 3) Create a PR to Reflect the New Changeset

Instead of merging this commit directly into the main branch, the changeset-bot creates a new PR so that users can review the changes and approve them manually.

![changeset-bot-create-pr](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-6.png)

Below is an example of a PR created by the changeset-bot.

### (3) 🦋 Approve the PR Reflecting the New Changeset

When you approve the PR created by the changeset-bot in the previous step, the following command will run in the `release` workflow.

```bash
pnpm changeset publish
```

![release-workflow-log](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-8.png)

This command performs the following tasks:

#### 1) 📝 Update Package Versions and Changelog

- The `version` field in `package.json` is updated,
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file is updated.

![file-changes-by-changesets-versioning](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-9.png)

#### 2) 🏷 Create Release Tags

When the PR is approved, GitHub Actions automatically runs and creates release tags for each package.

![created-release-tag](/assets/images/packages/versioning-and-publishing/img-10.png)

#### 3) 🚀 Publish to npm

The updated package(s) are published to npm. \
To publish, `NPM_TOKEN` must be set in GitHub Secrets.
