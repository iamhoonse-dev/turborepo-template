# üèóÔ∏è Build Process

This document provides an explanation of how packages are built in this project to help you understand the build process.

## ‚ö° Vite-based Build

The packages provided in this project are built using Vite.

|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/http-clients">`http-clients`</LocalizedLink>|[|[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)|
|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/node-utils">`packages/node-utils`</LocalizedLink>|[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)|

<Callout type="info">
  ESLint plugin packages such as <LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/eslint-plugin-sample">`eslint-plugin-sample`</LocalizedLink> are designed not to go through a separate build process.
  Instead, ESLint plugin packages are set to use the `index.js` file in the `lib` directory directly
  via the `files`, `main`, and `exports` fields in `package.json`.
</Callout>

### Rationale

The reasons for using Vite to build packages are as follows:

> _"Assuming that each package will be published as an npm package, Vite's build functionality is used to bundle the source code of each package and generate optimized output."_

### Features

The packages provided in this project are commonly designed with the following features:

#### 1) Support for ESModule and CommonJS Systems

Each package is built in both ESModule (`.es.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs.js`) formats to support various environments.
This is implemented using the library mode and Rollup settings in the Vite build configuration.

```js filename="packages/browser-utils/vite.config.js" {11}
/// <reference types="vitest" />
// ...other import statements...

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  // ...other settings...
  build: {
    // ...other settings...
    lib: {
      // ...other settings...
      formats: ["es", "cjs"], // Build as ESModule and CommonJS
      fileName: (format, entryName) => `${entryName}/index.${format}.js`,
    },
  },
});

```
#### 2) Type Declaration File Generation

Each package is written in TypeScript and automatically generates type declaration files (`.d.ts`) during the build.
This is achieved by using the `vite-plugin-dts` plugin, which is configured to generate type declaration files for each entry.

```js filename="packages/browser-utils/vite.config.js" {3,8}
/// <reference types="vitest" />
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import dtsPlugin from "vite-plugin-dts";
// ...other import statements...

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [dtsPlugin({ include: ["src"] }), tsConfigPaths()],
  // ...other settings...
});

```

#### 3) Tree Shaking and Code Splitting Support

Each package is optimized so that unused code is not included in the build output by utilizing Vite's tree shaking and code splitting features.

This is achieved by separating each feature into submodules via the `exports` field in each package's `package.json`, and

```json filename="packages/browser-utils/package.json"
{
  "exports": {
    "./dom": {
      "types": "./dist/dom/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/dom/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/dom/index.cjs.js"
    },
    "./msw": {
      "types": "./dist/msw/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/msw/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/msw/index.cjs.js"
    },
    "./string": {
      "types": "./dist/string/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/string/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/string/index.cjs.js"
    }
  },
  // ...other settings...
}
```

by configuring each source file as an entry point for bundling.

```js filename="packages/browser-utils/vite.config.js" {11-22}
/// <reference types="vitest" />
// ...other import statements...
import { runWithGlob } from "@repo/helpers/runWithGlob";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  // ...other settings...
  build: {
    lib: {
      // ...other settings...
      entry: Object.fromEntries(
        runWithGlob(
          "src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
          (file) => [
            // Entry name
            file.replace(/^src\//, "").replace(/index\.(ts|tsx)$/, ""),
            // Absolute path
            resolve(__dirname, file),
          ],
          ["src/**/*.{d,spec}.ts"],
        ),
      ),
      fileName: (format, entryName) => `${entryName}/index.${format}.js`,
    },
  },
});
```

#### 4) Developer Convenience

Each package provides the following features for convenient use in the development environment:

- Supports HMR via the `pnpm dev` command.
- Provides scripts for TypeScript and linter checks.
- Supports TypeScript path aliases, allowing convenient module paths when importing code within the workspace.
- Provides a basic environment and scripts for running tests based on Vitest.
  - For browser DOM and React-related packages, the test environment is set up using `@testing-library/react` and `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

## Usage in Other Packages and Applications

Other packages and applications that depend on the packages in this project are set up to use the built output (`dist`) of each package.
This is defined in the `files` and `exports` fields of each package's `package.json`.

For example, the `package.json` file of the `react-utils` package is configured as follows:

<Callout type="info">
  With this configuration, when other packages or applications that depend on the `react-utils` package install it using `pnpm`,
  the built output (`dist`) will be used.
  That is, the `node_modules/@repo/react-utils` directory of the dependent package or application will contain the built output (`dist`).
</Callout>

```json filename="packages/react-utils/package.json"
{
  // ...existing code...
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
  "exports": {
    "./hooks": {
      "types": "./dist/hooks/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/hooks/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/hooks/index.cjs.js"
    },
    "./hocs": {
      "types": "./dist/hocs/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/hocs/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/hocs/index.cjs.js"
    },
    "./providers": {
      "types": "./dist/providers/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/providers/index.es.js",
      "require": "./dist/providers/index.cjs.js"
    }
  },
  // ...existing code...
}
```

## HMR Support in Development Environment (`pnpm dev`)

As explained above, other packages or applications that depend on the packages in this project are designed to use the actual built output (`dist`) of those packages.

Therefore, even when running the `pnpm dev` command in the development environment,
the development server runs using the built output (`dist`) of each package.

To reflect changes in the developing package in real time,
the `dev` script of each package is set up as follows to use Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) feature.

```json filename="packages/react-utils/package.json"
{
  // ...existing code...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "tsc -b && vite build --watch",
    // ...other scripts...
  },
  // ...existing code...
}
```

## Linter and TypeScript Checks

Since other packages or applications that depend on the packages in this project are designed to use the actual built output (`dist`),

if the `dist` directory does not exist at the time when linter checks (`pnpm run lint`) or TypeScript checks (`pnpm run check-types`) are run in the dependent packages or applications, errors may occur.

Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the `dist` directory for all packages has been generated before running linter or TypeScript checks.
To achieve this, the `lint` and `check-types` tasks in Turborepo are set to depend on the build task as follows:

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  // ...existing code...
  "tasks": {
    // ...other tasks...
    "lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["build", "^lint"]
    },
    "check-types": {
      "dependsOn": ["build", "^check-types"]
    },
    // ...other tasks...
  },
  // ...existing code...
}
```
