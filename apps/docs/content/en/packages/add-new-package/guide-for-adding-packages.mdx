# 📋 Add by Copying

This document explains how to add a new package by copying an existing package.

<Callout type="info">
  The packages included in this project are originally designed to be used as templates for creating other packages.
</Callout>

## 📋 Copying

The simplest way to add a new package is to copy an existing sample package in the `packages` directory and create a new package from it.
By doing this, you can start a new package while inheriting the settings of the existing package.

### 🎯 Select a Package Template for Your Purpose

When adding a new package, it is recommended to select and copy a package template that matches your purpose:

|Item|Template Package|Purpose|
|-|-|-|
|Browser Utilities|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/browser-utils">`packages/browser-utils`</LocalizedLink>|Utility functions for browser environments|
|Node.js Utilities|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/node-utils">`packages/node-utils`</LocalizedLink>|Utility functions for Node.js environments|
|React Utilities|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/react-utils">`packages/react-utils`</LocalizedLink>|Utility functions for React applications|
|React UI Components|<LocalizedLink href="packages/default-packages/react-ui">`packages/react-ui`</LocalizedLink>|UI components for React applications|

<Callout type="info">
  For ESLint plugin packages, instead of copying a template package,
  it is recommended to refer to the <LocalizedLink href="packages/add-new-package/eslint-plugin">`Add New Package > ESLint Plugin`</LocalizedLink> document
  and generate it using the yeoman CLI.
</Callout>

## ✅ What to Do After Copying

After copying, perform the following tasks:

### 📝 Edit Package Metadata

1. **Rename the package directory**: Change the name of the package directory to the new package name.
2. **Change the package name**: Change the `name` field in the `package.json` file to the new package name.
3. **Change the package description**: Update the `description` field in the `package.json` file to a description suitable for the new package.
4. **Initialize the package version**: Set the `version` field in the `package.json` file to `0.0.0`.
5. **Review the package license**: Check the `license` field in the `package.json` file and modify it if necessary.

### 🏗️ Package Build Settings
