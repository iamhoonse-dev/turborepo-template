## Configuring npm Publishing in `package.json`

To publish to npm, you need to configure the `publishConfig` and `private` fields in the `package.json` file of each package to be published.

- The `publishConfig` field should have the `access` property set to `public`,
- The `private` field should be set to `false`.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "private": false,
  "publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
  },
  // ...
}
```
