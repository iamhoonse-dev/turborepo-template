# ðŸ§ª Vitest Config

The `configs/vitest-config` workspace provides shared Vitest test configuration that can be used across multiple packages and apps in the monorepo.

## Main Purpose

- Maintains a consistent test environment and options across the project.
- Each workspace (app/package) can extend or use this configuration as-is.

## Main Components

- **base.ts**  
  The base Vitest options applied to all packages/apps.
- **ui.ts**  
  Options specialized for testing React/Next.js UI libraries and apps.
- **node.ts**  
  Options specialized for testing packages running in Node.js environments.

## How to Use

### Extending

In each workspace's `vitest.config.ts`, you can import and use `@repo/vitest-config/{configName}`.

```ts filename="packages/react-ui/vitest.config.ts" {3,9}
import { mergeConfig } from "vite";
import { defineProject } from "vitest/config";
import uiTestConfig from "@repo/vitest-config/ui";
import viteConfig from "./vite.config";

export default mergeConfig(
  viteConfig,
  mergeConfig(
    uiTestConfig,
    defineProject({ test: { setupFiles: ["./src/tests/setup.ts"] } }),
  ),
);
```

## Test Coverage Collection Settings

The `configs/vitest-config` workspace uses Turbo to automatically collect and merge coverage reports from multiple packages and generate a final report, providing the following tasks:

- **collect-json-reports**  
  Collects coverage results (`coverage/raw/**`) from each package.
- **merge-json-reports**  
  Merges the collected coverage reports and stores them in `coverage/merged/**`.
- **report**  
  Generates the final coverage report (`coverage/report/**`) based on the merged coverage data.
- **view-report**  
  Allows you to view the report after the final coverage report is generated.

These tasks are defined as Turbo tasks, making it easy to aggregate and manage test coverage across the entire monorepo.

## Reference

- For actual options and detailed settings, refer to each config file in the `configs/vitest-config/configs` directory.
- If you need new shared test options, add them to this workspace to apply them to the entire project.
