# ðŸŽ­ Playwright Config

The `configs/playwright-config` workspace provides shared Playwright test configuration that can be used across multiple packages and apps in the monorepo.

## Main Purpose

- Maintains a consistent E2E test environment and Playwright options across the project.
- Each workspace (app/package) can extend or use this configuration as-is.

## Main Components

- **`base.ts`**\
  The base Playwright options applied to all packages/apps.

## How to Use

### Extending

In each workspace's `playwright.config.ts`, you can import and use `@repo/playwright-config/{configName}`.

```ts filename="tools/playwright-web/playwright.config.ts" {2,16}
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import base from "@repo/playwright-config/base";

/**
 * Read environment variables from file.
 * https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
 */
// import dotenv from 'dotenv';
// import path from 'path';
// dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.env') });

/**
 * See https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.
 */
export default defineConfig({
  ...base,
  reporter: [["list"], ["junit", { outputFile: "test-results/junit.xml" }]],
});
```

## Reference

- For actual options and detailed settings, refer to each config file in the `configs/playwright-config` workspace.
- If you need new shared options, add them to this workspace to apply them to the entire project.
