# üõ°Ô∏è ESLint Config

The `configs/eslint-config` workspace provides shared ESLint configuration that can be used across multiple packages and apps in the monorepo.

## Main Purpose

- Defines common ESLint rules to maintain consistent code style and quality.
- Each workspace (app/package) can extend or use this configuration as-is.

## Main Components

- **`base.js`**\
  The base configuration file defining fundamental ESLint rules.
- **`react-internal.js`**\
  Configuration file including additional rules specialized for React projects.
- **`next.js`**\
  Configuration file including additional rules specialized for Next.js projects.

## How to Use

### Use As-Is

In each workspace's ESLint config file, you can import and use `@repo/eslint-config/{configName}`.

```js filename="apps/web/eslint.config.js"
import { nextJsConfig } from "@repo/eslint-config/next-js";

/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
export default nextJsConfig;
```

### Extending

You can also extend the config and define additional rules as needed.

<Callout type="info">
  The `apps/frontend-workshop` workspace also extends `@repo/eslint-config/react-internal`.
  Refer to that workspace's ESLint config to see how to extend shared rules.
  For more details, see the <LocalizedLink href="/conventions/eslint">`Conventions > ESLint`</LocalizedLink> document.
</Callout>

```js
// Example: apps/frontend-workshop/eslint.config.js
import { config } from "@repo/eslint-config/react-internal";

export default {
  extends: [...config],
  // You can define additional rules here
};
```

## Reference

- For actual rules and detailed settings, refer to each config file in the `configs/eslint-config` workspace.
- If you need new shared rules, add them to this workspace to apply them to the entire project.
