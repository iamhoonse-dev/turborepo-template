# 🤖 GitHub Actions

This project utilizes GitHub Actions to build an automated CI/CD pipeline.
By automating key development and operational processes such as code quality verification, testing, building, and deployment, we improve development efficiency and maintain code quality.

## Main Workflows

- **Test**
  Automatically runs whenever code is pushed, performing various verification processes such as unit tests, E2E tests, and Storybook tests.

- **Release**
  Runs when changes are detected in the `main` branch, automating package version management and the creation of release PRs based on Changesets.

- **Publish Github Pages**
  Builds the documentation site statically and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch, automatically providing the latest documentation via GitHub Pages.
