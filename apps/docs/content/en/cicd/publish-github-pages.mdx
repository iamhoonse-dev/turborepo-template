## Workflow Overview

This workflow automatically deploys the documentation site to GitHub Pages.
It mainly runs when changes are detected in the `main` branch, builds the static site, and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch.

- Install and cache dependencies
- Build the static site
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Execution Flow

### Sequential Execution

This workflow consists of a single job and executes the following steps in order.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CO[Checkout Repo]
    PNPM[Setup pnpm]
    NODE[Setup Node.js]
    INST[Install Dependencies]
    BUILD[Build Docs]
    DEPLOY[Deploy to GitHub Pages]

    CO --> PNPM --> NODE --> INST --> BUILD --> DEPLOY
```

## Main Stage Descriptions

### Checkout Repo

- Checks out the repository code.

### Setup pnpm

- Sets up the pnpm package manager.

### Setup Node.js

- Installs the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file and enables pnpm cache.

### Install Dependencies

- Installs dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.

### Build Docs

- Builds the documentation site statically.
  (e.g., use `pnpm run build` or `pnpm docs:build` depending on your project)

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

- Deploys the built static files to the `gh-pages` branch for hosting on GitHub Pages.
- Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` to grant deployment permissions.

Through this workflow, the documentation site is automatically deployed and kept up to date.
