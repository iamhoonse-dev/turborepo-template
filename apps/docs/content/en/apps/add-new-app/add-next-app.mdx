# ▲ Add a New Next App

## 📋 Copy and Add

1. In your terminal, navigate to the project root and copy the `apps/empty-next-app` folder to create a new app folder.

   Example:
   ```bash
   cp -R apps/empty-next-app apps/your-new-app-name
   ```

2. Change the folder name and update the app name in files like `package.json` inside the copied folder as desired.

3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter your-new-app-name dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Additional Configuration

The template (`apps/empty-next-app`) includes only minimal settings, so feel free to customize it as needed for your project.

- Edit configuration files like `next.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, etc. as necessary.
- To add dependencies on other apps in the monorepo, refer to the <LocalizedLink href="/packages/using-in-other-workspaces">`Packages > Using Packages in Other Workspaces`</LocalizedLink> document.

## 💡 Notes

-
- If you encounter issues, refer to the settings of existing apps (such as `apps/web`) or check the README.
