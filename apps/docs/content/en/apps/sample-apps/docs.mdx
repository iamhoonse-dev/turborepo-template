# 📖 Docs App

## 📝 Introduction

The `apps/docs` workspace is a Next.js-based application responsible for documentation (Docs) within the monorepo.
It leverages Nextra and the Nextra Docs theme to help you build fast and efficient documentation sites.
It provides documentation, guides, and examples for various packages, modules, and components in the project, making it easy for both developers and users to find information.

## 🚀 Nextra-based Documentation System

This app is built on **Nextra** and the **Nextra Docs theme**. Nextra is a powerful documentation site framework running on Next.js, offering the following advantages:

### Benefits of Next.js

- **Based on Next.js**: Uses the latest Next.js framework to provide fast and efficient static/dynamic documentation pages.
- **MDX Support**: Supports the MDX format, combining Markdown and JSX, so you can use React components within your docs.
- **Monorepo Integration**: Integrated with other apps/packages in the Turborepo environment, making it easy to reference shared components and utilities.
- **Custom Components**: Define custom components for use in docs via `mdx-components.ts`.

### Benefits of Nextra

- **Rapid Documentation**: Easily build documentation sites using just folder structure and MDX files.
- **Theme Support**: Offers stylish documentation themes and various customization options via `nextra-theme-docs`.
- **Built-in Search**: Integrates with Pagefind for fast full-document search even after static builds.
- **Versioning & i18n**: Easily manage documentation versions and multiple languages via Nextra settings.

## ⚙️ Main Configuration & Customization

- Set Nextra theme and options in `next.config.js`.
- Define custom components for MDX in `mdx-components.ts`.
- Adding MDX files in the `content/` folder automatically creates documentation pages.

## 📂 Directory Structure

- `app/` : Next.js routes and page components
- `components/` : UI components used in docs
- `containers/` : Documentation layout and container components
- `content/` : Actual documentation (MDX) files
    - `ko/` : Korean docs
    - `en/` : English docs
    - `ja/` : Japanese docs
- `public/` : Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
- `tests/` : Test code

## 💡 Usage Example

To add documentation, create MDX files in the language-specific folders (e.g., `ko/`, `en/`, `ja/`) under `content/`. \
You can use custom components in MDX files as shown below:

  For more details on writing documentation, see the <LocalizedLink href="/documentation/how-to-write">`Documentation > How to Write Docs`</LocalizedLink> page.
</Callout>

```mdx filename="content/ko/example.mdx"
import CustomComponent from "../../components/CustomComponent";

description: Example of writing documentation.

# Example Document

<CustomComponent />
```

## 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install --filter apps/docs
```

## 🛠️ Development & Run

To run the documentation site in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev --filter apps/docs
```

## 🏗️ Build

The documentation site is built as a static site for deployment. Build it with:

```bash
pnpm run build --filter apps/docs
```

## 🚢 Deployment
Since the documentation site is built as static files, you can deploy the generated files to any web server.
For example, you can use Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and more.

<Callout type="info">
  In this project, the docs app is set up to deploy to GitHub Pages via a GitHub Actions workflow.
