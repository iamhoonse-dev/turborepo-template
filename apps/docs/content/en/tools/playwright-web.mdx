# 🎭 Playwright Runner

The `tools/playwright-web` package provides the environment and scripts for automating E2E (End-to-End) tests based on Playwright for this project.

## 🎯 Main Purpose

- Simulates user actions in a real browser environment to verify main flows and features.
- Runs automatically in CI environments (such as GitHub Actions) to ensure service quality before deployment.

## 📁 Main Components

- **🧪 Test Scripts**:\
  Playwright test files (`*.spec.ts`) are located in the `tests/` directory.
- **⚙️ Playwright Configuration**:\
  The `playwright.config.ts` file configures browsers, test environments, report formats (junit, etc.), and more.
- **▶️ Run Script**:\
  You can run Playwright tests using the `test:e2e` script in `package.json`.
- **🐳 Dockerfile**:\
  Defines a Docker image for running tests in CI environments.

## 🧑‍💻️ How to Use

### 💻 Run Locally

```bash
pnpm --filter tools/playwright-web test:e2e
```

or

```bash
cd tools/playwright-web
pnpm test:e2e
```

### 🤖 Run in CI Environment

- The `e2e-web` job in `.github/workflows/test.yml` automatically runs this in a Docker container.
- Test results are saved as JUnit XML, etc., and uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts.
