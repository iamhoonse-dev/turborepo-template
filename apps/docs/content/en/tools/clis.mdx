# üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è Monorepo CLI

## üìñ Overview

This project provides a set of command-line interface (CLI) tools for developers to manage a monorepo codebase.
These tools mainly help manage directories and files, and perform tasks such as replacing specific strings within the codebase.
They are designed to simplify maintenance and management tasks, and to help maintain consistency across the codebase.

## üì¶ Provided Features

### **`example`**
A CLI tool for managing directories and files. Main features:
- `-l, --ls [value]`: Lists the contents of a directory. If `value` is not specified, lists the current directory.
- `-m, --mkdir <value>`: Creates a new directory.
- `-t, --touch <value>`: Creates a new file.

### **`change-owner-name`**
A CLI tool that traverses all files in the codebase and replaces occurrences of the owner ID.
- `-n, --name <value>`: Specifies the new owner name.

### **`rename-repository`**
A CLI tool that traverses all files in the codebase and replaces occurrences of the repository name.
- `-n, --name <value>`: Specifies the new repository name.

### **`rename-scope`**
A CLI tool that traverses all files in the codebase and replaces the scope part (e.g. `@repo/`) before package names.
- `-n, --name <value>`: Specifies the new scope name.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

change-owner-name -n your-username

# or equivalently

change-owner-name --name your-username
```

### `rename-repository` command

#### Change repository name

```bash
