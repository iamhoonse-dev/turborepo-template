# ðŸ¦‹ Writing a New Changeset

This document explains how to manage and publish package versions using `pnpm changeset`.
Specifically, it describes the process for recording changes to update a package's version.
To write a changeset for a package, run the following commands in your local environment:

1. Add a new changeset: When you run the command, a prompt will appear for you to describe the changes. This allows you to record the changes.
    ```bash
    pnpm changeset
    ```

2. Update versions and apply changes: This command updates the versions of all packages and creates or updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    ```bash
    pnpm changeset version
    ```
3. Publish: This command publishes the updated packages to npm. To publish, `NPM_TOKEN` must be set in GitHub Secrets.
    ```bash
    pnpm changeset publish
    ```
