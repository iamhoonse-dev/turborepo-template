## üîó Link Writing Guide

### Reflecting Locale

This documentation application supports multiple languages. Therefore, when creating links, you must specify the locale in the pathname.
In other words, the locale indicates the language and region of the document and must be included in the URL path.

#### Basic Usage

When creating links, you must reflect the locale.
For example, a link to the `content/ko/sample.mdx` document written in Korean should be set to `/ko/sample`.
Here is a correct example:

```mdx
[Korean Document Sample](/ko/sample)
```

#### Using the `<LocalizedLink>` Component

By using the `<LocalizedLink>` component, you can automatically generate links that reflect the locale.
For example, if the current user is viewing the Korean page, writing the code as below
will automatically convert the link to `/ko/sample`:

```mdx filename="link-usage.mdx"
<LocalizedLink href="/sample">Korean Document Sample</LocalizedLink>
```

```html filename="rendered-link.html"
<a
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  href="/ko/setup/github-pages"
>
  Korean Document Sample
</a>
```
