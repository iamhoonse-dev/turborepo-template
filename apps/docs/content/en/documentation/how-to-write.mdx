# ‚úèÔ∏è How to Write

This document provides a guide on how to write documentation. Please read this guide before writing documents.

## üîó Link Writing Guide

### Reflecting Locale

This documentation application supports multiple languages. Therefore, when creating links, you must specify the locale in the pathname.
In other words, the locale indicates the language and region of the document and must be included in the URL path.

#### Basic Usage

When creating links, you must reflect the locale.
For example, a link to the `content/ko/sample.mdx` document written in Korean should be set to `/ko/sample`.
Here is a correct example:

```mdx
[Korean Document Sample](/ko/sample)
```

#### Using the `<LocalizedLink>` Component

This documentation application provides a `<LocalizedLink>` component.
By using this component, you can automatically generate links that reflect the locale.

For example, if the current user is viewing the Korean page, writing the code as below
will automatically convert the link to `/ko/sample`:

<Callout type="info">
  Absolute path imports are not allowed in the current project. \
  Therefore, when using the `<LocalizedLink>` component to write links, you must use a relative path.
</Callout>

```mdx filename="link-usage.mdx"
import LocalizedLink from "../../../components/LocalizedLink";

<LocalizedLink href="/sample">Korean Document Sample</LocalizedLink>
```

```html filename="rendered-link.html"
<a
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  href="/ko/setup/github-pages"
>
  Korean Document Sample
</a>
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Attachment Guide

### Uploading Images

Images to be used in the documentation should be uploaded to the `apps/docs/public` directory.

### Inserting Images into Documents

For example, if you uploaded an image to `apps/docs/public/assets/images/sample-image.png`,
insert the image in your document as follows:

```mdx filename="image-usage.mdx"
![Image description](/assets/images/sample-image.png)
```
