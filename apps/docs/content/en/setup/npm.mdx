# ðŸ“¦ NPM

This project is configured to allow some packages to be published to NPM.
This document explains the basic setup for publishing to NPM.

## Setting up the npm token (Optional)

You need to set the `NPM_TOKEN` as a secret variable in your project.
This token is used to publish packages to npm.
To add `NPM_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets, follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Click the `Settings` tab.
3. Go to the `Secrets and variables` section.
4. Select `Actions`.
5. Click the `New repository secret` button.
6. Add the token issued from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as `NPM_TOKEN`.
7. In the [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) file, uncomment the `publish` step at the end of the "Create Release Pull Request" stage.
