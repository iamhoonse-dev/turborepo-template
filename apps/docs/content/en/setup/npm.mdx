# ðŸ“¦ NPM

This project is configured to allow some packages to be published to NPM.
This document explains the basic setup for publishing to NPM.

## Setting up the npm token (Optional)

You need to set the `NPM_TOKEN` as a secret variable in your project.
This token is used to publish packages to npm.
To add `NPM_TOKEN` to GitHub Secrets, follow these steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repository page.
2. Click the `Settings` tab.
3. Go to the `Secrets and variables` section.
4. Select `Actions`.
5. Click the `New repository secret` button.
6. Add the token issued from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as `NPM_TOKEN`.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/release.yml" {12}
      - name: Create Release Pull Request
        uses: changesets/action@v1
        with:
          version: pnpm version-packages
          # publish: pnpm publish-packages # fixme: if you want to publish packages, uncomment this line
          commit: |
            chore(release): ðŸ¦‹ versioning packages by changesets
          title: |
            ðŸ¦‹ Versioning packages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # fixme: if you want to publish packages, set this secret on your repo
```

## Workflow setup for npm publishing (Optional)

This project defines a release workflow for NPM publishing, adopting a changesets-based deployment process.
This workflow automatically updates package versions, records changes, and publishes to NPM when a PR is approved.

### Uncommenting the release.yml file

Package versioning in the release workflow is enabled by default, but npm publishing is not.
To enable npm publishing, you need to uncomment the `publish` step in the `release.yml` file.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/release.yml" {5}
      - name: Create Release Pull Request
        uses: changesets/action@v1
        with:
          version: pnpm version-packages
          # publish: pnpm publish-packages # fixme: if you want to publish packages, uncomment this line
          commit: |
            chore(release): ðŸ¦‹ versioning packages by changesets
          title: |
            ðŸ¦‹ Versioning packages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} # fixme: if you want to publish packages, set this secret on your repo
```
